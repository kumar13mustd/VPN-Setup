# VPN-Setup

VPN: A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that encrypts your internet connection and hides your IP address to protect your online privacy and security.

Use: I used ProtonVPN (Free Tier) for this task. It is a secure and reliable free VPN service that provides strong encryption and does not log user activity.

Steps:
1. Signed up for a free ProtonVPN account on https://protonvpn.com
2. Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client on my computer.
3. Logged in using my account credentials.
4. Connected to a VPN server (choose nearest free server for better speed).
5. Verified my IP change by visiting https://whatismyipaddress.com
6. Browsed websites to confirm that my traffic was encrypted.
7. Disconnected from the VPN and checked the IP again to compare results.
8. Researched VPN encryption, tunneling, and privacy features.

Benefits:
1. Hides my real IP address and location.
2. Encrypts my internet traffic for privacy.
3. Protects data on public Wi-Fi networks.
4. Allows access to geo-restricted websites.
5. Prevents ISP tracking and monitoring.

Limitations:
1. Free versions may have limited servers and slower speed.
2. VPNs cannot guarantee full anonymity (ISP can still see VPN usage).
3. Some websites may block VPN IPs.
4. High encryption may cause slight internet slowdown.
